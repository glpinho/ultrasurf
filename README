This program is dedicated to processing and extracting useful information from
digital images captured from experiments of fluid mechanics, aiming validation
of numerical models.

It will soon have 3 main sections:
    1 - Discrete Analysis:
        Recognizing bubbles and droplets, generally particles, and extracting
        information from them:
            - Position;
            - Hydraulic diameter;
            - Velocity.

    2 - Continuum Analysis:
        A classic Particle Image Velocimetry program, able to generate a
        velocity field from pairs of images taken from a de facto one-phase flow
        with tracing particles. The program will be capable of generating:
            - Streamlines;
            - Videos.
    3 - Interface Analysis:
        This program will analyse images from two-phase flow in wave and slug
        regimes and it should be capable of identifying the position of the
        liquid-gas interface, and maybe calculating the interfacial velocities.

Some functions will be written in C++ for performance, others in MATLAB/Octave.
The Graphical User Interface will be written in Python, with PyQt5.
